# SPA-useContext-useReducer-2

_Original Text:_
Create a to-do list web application that allows the user to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application should have an input field for adding new tasks and display a list of all existing tasks. For each task in the list, the user should have the ability to edit or delete it. If the user selects a task to edit, an input field should be displayed where the task can be edited. After the user has completed the editing, the updated task should be saved.

**Task:**
**Please move all the logic into a ContextProvider that takes care of all states or state changes. The other components should serve to display the to-do list. If you like, you can split the input for entering to-dos and the list of to-dos into two separate components.**
